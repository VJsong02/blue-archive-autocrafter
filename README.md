# crafterer
imagine crafting stuff in blue archive by hand

the goal of this little script is to let you pick and order the nodes you want to have crafted, then the script just spams crafts until you run out of mats.

(you'll need..... python3 (obviously) and opencv and an emulator (i used bluestacks 5) running at 1280x720 with adb enabled)
